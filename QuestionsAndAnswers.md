#### Answer: C

<i>In this code nums is an array and it was looped by the forEach() method. The forEach() method takes a callback function as an argument. The callback function is called once for each element in the array. At first call 0 is false that's why the code doesn't add 1 to count. Then all three element is true that's why count increase 1 each time and count became 3. Then count was logged - (3)</i>
